# Bash
Random bash script snippets made for whatever the need was..

## uv-seuraaja (uv-tracker)
Uses open data from [FMI](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data) to keep track of one UV-measuring location's measurements. Made to work with [xfce4-genmon](https://docs.xfce.org/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin/start). 

## ASCII/ANSI art
Candles, Flag, Snow, Snowman & Tree are small art pieces inspired by prompts in our x-mas calendar. Very small, much art.

## Embedded terminal
Wanted to have a terminal staring at me at all times so I would start using it. First script ever, few days after switching to Linux. Didn't actually write it, but cleverly copy-pasted things I found online.  
Useful manuals to have when customizing:  
* [Understanding Linux .bashrc and .bash_profile](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/bashrc-and-bash-profile)
* [Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html#SEC_Contents) 
* See Manual for your chosen terminal emulator for specific options

## GlaDOS Still alive
Kid wanted to make her Linux Portal-themed, so I found some fun things for her. This is modified to our needs from here: [Turning Bash into GlaDOS and other fun trics](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=92151). I did NOT write this one especially. Script prints out lyrics to Still alive and is synced to the song. Insane.

## Selopticon 

Selectively seeing eye for tracking activity for Testaustime on non-plugin editors.
