# Bash
Random bash script snippets made for whatever the need was..

## Embedded terminal
Wanted to have a terminal staring at me at all times so I would start using it. First script ever, few days after switching to Linux. Didn't actually write it, but cleverly copy-pasted things I found online.  
Useful manuals to have when customizing:  
* [Understanding Linux .bashrc and .bash_profile](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/bashrc-and-bash-profile)
* [Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html#SEC_Contents) 
* See Manual for your chosen terminal emulator for specific options

## GlaDOS Still alive
Kid wanted to make her Linux Portal-themed, so I found some fun things for her. This is modified to our needs from here: [Turning Bash into GlaDOS and other fun trics](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=92151) I did NOT write this one especially. Script prints out lyrics to Still alive and is synced to the song. Insane.
